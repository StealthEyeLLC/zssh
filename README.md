# Z / zssh — SSH-Native Sovereign Linux Computers

Z is a lifecycle-aware SSH fabric for persistent, unrestricted local Linux computers.

> A Z machine is a real KVM Linux computer with a stable SSH identity, reachable without guest IP networking, and compatible with the ordinary OpenSSH ecosystem.

Canonical repository: `StealthEyeLLC/zssh`  
Product names: **Z**, **z**, or **zssh**

## Current state

This repository package initializes the governing architecture and documentation system. **Implementation has not started and no runtime capability is claimed.** The first valid implementation checkpoint is defined by [`docs/BUILD.md`](docs/BUILD.md): boot a real machine, open unrestricted root, persist a filesystem change, reboot, reconnect through authenticated SSH, and preserve the change.

## Product contract

Z composes KVM, Cloud Hypervisor, OpenSSH, AF_VSOCK, systemd, ordinary files, and narrowly scoped optional helpers. It does not reconstruct Linux as a product API.

The baseline requires:

- unrestricted root inside an ordinary persistent Linux guest;
- OpenSSH over AF_VSOCK as the primary access surface;
- exact non-shell execution through guest-native systemd transient units;
- no Z guest agent or custom guest protocol;
- no product database, permanent controller, or hidden scheduler;
- ordinary raw disks and owner-visible machine directories;
- zero Z processes when all machines are stopped.

## Start here

- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) — mandatory entry point for agents and implementers.
- [`docs/INDEX.md`](docs/INDEX.md) — canonical documentation map.
- [`docs/MANIFEST.md`](docs/MANIFEST.md) — document status and purpose.
- [`docs/reference/SEARCH-INDEX.md`](docs/reference/SEARCH-INDEX.md) — aliases and question-to-document lookup.
- [`llms.txt`](llms.txt) — compact machine-readable discovery surface.

## Normative precedence

1. [`docs/INVARIANTS.md`](docs/INVARIANTS.md)
2. [`docs/ANTI-INVARIANTS.md`](docs/ANTI-INVARIANTS.md)
3. [`docs/SACRIFICES.md`](docs/SACRIFICES.md)

10. [`docs/CERTIFICATION.md`](docs/CERTIFICATION.md)

Research, reference material, issue templates, tests, and implementation convenience cannot override that order.

## SSH-native architecture in one paragraph

OpenSSH owns established sessions end to end. Native clients use descriptor handoff so Z starts and verifies the computer, connects the Cloud Hypervisor vsock mux, passes the connected descriptor to OpenSSH, and exits from the byte path. A separate transparent stdio compatibility profile supports SSH libraries that cannot accept descriptor passing. Static AF_VSOCK socket activation and stock `sshd -i` provide the guest endpoint. Interactive SSH, exact systemd execution, SFTP, and SSH forwarding remain complementary standard planes rather than a custom guest protocol.

## Repository layout

See [`FOLDER-TREE.md`](FOLDER-TREE.md). The major areas are:

- `docs/` — governing law and architecture.
- `docs/research/` — non-normative research and source ledger.
- `docs/reference/` — glossary, compatibility policy, and search map.
- `evidence/` — future immutable checkpoint evidence.
- `assets/` — future pinned asset manifests and provenance.
- `src/`, `tests/`, `scripts/` — implementation areas, currently intentionally empty except for boundary documentation.
- `.github/` — agent instructions and change templates.
